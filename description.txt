This is a slight fork of the Lights and Shadows mod I worked on a few years back. While this version includes some enhancements, it is not intended to replace the original.  

Enhancements:  
- Optimized and modularized code for better performance and usability. 
- Open-source. 
- Upgraded visual effects (stylized).  

Feel free to modify the .fx and texture files as you see fit.
NOTE: An XNB compiler is required to update effects.
